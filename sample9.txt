this is going some where else into the dark
a big brown dog chases a small cat.
the cat runs fast to escape the dog.
the sun shines brightly in the clear sky.
birds sing sweetly in the tall trees.
the children laugh and play with a big ball.
i like you more than anything i think is all you know

people walk and talk in the crowded park.
a big brown dog chases a small cat.
Why is now that is.
Interaction of somewhere in the middle
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
the dog barks loudly at the passing cars.
the cars drive
the wind blows gently through the green leaves.
people walk and talk in the crowded park.
the children laugh and play with a big ball.
i like you more than anything i think is all you know

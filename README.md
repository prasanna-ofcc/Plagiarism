# Plagiarism
A python Code to check plagiarism of text files
This Python script analyzes the similarity between a reference text file (`sample2.txt`) and multiple other files listed in `filename.txt`. It reads and tokenizes the content of each file, removes common stop words using `stopwords.txt`, and compares the meaningful words (non-stopwords) between the reference file and each target file. The script calculates how many words are common (intersection) and the total unique words (union) after stopword removal, then computes the percentage of similarity. Finally, it presents the results in a neatly formatted table using the `tabulate` module, showing each fileâ€™s name, number of common words, total meaningful words, and the percentage of similarity with the reference.

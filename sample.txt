people walk and talk in the crowded park.
a big brown dog chases a small cat.
Why is now that is.
Interaction of somewhere in the middle
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
the dog barks loudly at the passing cars.
the cars drive quickly down the busy street.
a big brown dog chases a small cat.
the cat runs fast to escape the dog.
the sun shines brightly in the clear sky.
birds sing sweetly in the tall trees.
the wind blows gently through the green leaves.
people walk and talk in the crowded park.
the children laugh and play with a big ball.
